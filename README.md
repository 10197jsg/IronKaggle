# 📈 Predicted Sales Output

This repository contains the output from a machine learning model that predicts sales based on input features. The file `predictions_output.csv` includes both the features used in prediction and the model's output values.

## 🧾 File Contents

### `predictions_output.csv`

| Column Name      | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Feature1         | Numeric feature used in the prediction     |
| Feature2         | Categorical feature used in the prediction |
| Predicted_Sales  | Predicted sales value (model output)       |

> Note: This is a sample structure; in the real dataset, the feature names and count may vary.

## 🔍 Objective

To use machine learning models to forecast future sales based on historical and contextual data. This output can help support strategic decisions in sales, marketing, and inventory management.

## 🧠 Model Summary

- The model was trained using supervised learning techniques.
- The final model predicts the target variable `Predicted_Sales`.
- The data was preprocessed using standard encoding and scaling techniques.

## 💡 Usage

You can load the CSV file using pandas in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("predictions_output.csv")
print(df.head())
```

## ✅ Example Output

```
   Feature1 Feature2  Predicted_Sales
0         1        A             1000
1         2        B             1500
2         3        C             1200
```
